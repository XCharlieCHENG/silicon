    "instruction_prompt": "You are a content moderation specialist tasked with classifying social media posts into the following categories:  'fearspeech', 'hatespeech', 'fearspeech, hatespeech', 'normal', and 'confused' for cases where the classification is unclear. Further, you also need to mark the target communities toward which the particular posts are targeted. This classification should be based on the content's intent and the targeted community. The label will be one of the specified categories based on the content's nature, and the target group should be identified based on who the post is directed at. The target group should be mentioned even if the label is 'normal' or 'confused', using 'other' for posts not targeting any specific group or 'unclear' if the target group cannot be determined.\n\n- Hate speech is a language used to express hatred toward a targeted individual or group or is intended to be derogatory to humiliate or to insult the members of the group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. A post is a hate speech if one or more of the following are true:\n• It is targeted against a person or group of persons.\n• It uses derogatory or racial slur words within the post.\n• It makes use of disparaging terms with the intent to harm or incite harm.\n• It refers to and supports other hateful facts, hate posts, and organization.\n• It refers to the other group as inferior as cultural superiority.\n• It makes use of idiomatic metaphorical collocation or any other indirect means of expressions that are harmful or may incite harm.\n• It expresses violent communications.\n\n- Fear speech is an expression aimed at instilling (existential) fear of a target group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. A post is a fear speech if it creates fear about a target group using one of the following notions:\n• Something done by the target group in the past (and the possibility of that happening again) - historical domination.\n• Some tradition of the target group which is shown to take precedence over in-groups - cultural domination.\n• The target group taking over jobs or education institutes economic domination.\n• The target group taking over land/ living places - geographic domination.\n• The target group killing people of the in-group - existential domination.\n• Speculation that the target group would take over and dominate in the future over the in group - future domination.\n\n- Normal speech is the label of the posts which are neither hate speech nor fear speech. Note that this class is not equivalent to unbiased or polite language.\n\n- Specific guidelines:\n• The presence of certain words (e.g., use of slur word, political propaganda) does not justify a text being hateful or fearful. The annotators should look into the context of the post.\n• Since some of the fear speech heavily used common news sources, please look into the post if it is a news headline or if it is trying to create or spread fear.\n• A post might be both partially hateful and partially fearful. Please carefully read the whole post before finalising the labels.\n• Fear and hate speech both should be about some target community (explicit or implicit). Fear/hate speech about media or government institutions are not considered in this task. Such cases should be marked as normal.\n\n- Some of the annotated examples are shown below:\n• \"I call bullshit on Google. How does a search for 'white parents with white children' return these images?\" is categorized as normal, targeting others.\n• \"Thousands of Americans have been killed by illegal aliens. Illegals break up American families forever. Go home. Stay home. Stop breeding out of control.\" is categorized as fearspeech, hatespeech, targeting refugees.\n• \"Toledo Tree-Dweller Guns Down White Man After an Argument at a Bar. Blacks routinely use homicide as their go-to for conflict resolution.\" is categorized as fearspeech, targeting African.\n• \"Today, do something for the environment and kill your local queer.\" is categorized as hatespeech, targeting homosexual.\n",
